· This reei of microfiirn contains materiei
which hes peper color changes, stains, or
illustrations (some of which may appear on
peges mixed with printed text). in order to
ensure that aii text end illustrations ere
iegibie exposure settinqs must be changed.
Therefore, when text end illustrations exist
in a sinqie image or when materiai
becquourtcis differ, such tremes may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure reflects the camere
operator’s best effert to capture tite majority
of the text; the second exposure reflects tite

cernere operator’s best effert to capture
iilustrative materiei or tite remaining text. it

is hoped thet this practice wiii resuit in a

microfiirn product that fuiiy serves the needs
of most reseercriers
